CODE VERSIONING
-zipped files with 'SVR' code are copied over from \\arcserver-svr\D\PPA_v2_SVR, which
is a folder registered with ArcPortal and thus supposed to be callable in web tools.

-Tests and updates to code will still happen to I drive versions and be tested on the "desktop" version of the tool.
-If edit results happen, then the updated code will be copied/pasted to the server-based code repository.

WHEN TRANSFERRING OVER, make sure that you don't overwrite anything that needs to stay permanent on the SVR versions (e.g.,
the folder path refs in the main script and ppa_input_params need to stay different for the SVR versus I drive copies of the code.
